I am (or was, dependending on when you are reading this) a dual-degree computer science BSc/MSc student at the Rochester Institute of Technology in upstate, NY. So far, it has been five years since I started my studies in computer science. When I first started out in school, I didn’t know anything about the topic. However, through the - so far - six semesters of study I have come to grasp a good foundation on general programming, theory, and a little bit of history (as a treat). At some point along the way, although my initial ambition was to aim for a career in video game development after university, I became interested in the more scientific and mathematical aspects of computer science. Through the public unveiling of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as other earlier applications of machine learning, I ultimately decided that a future career in machine learning engineering and eventually research would come to satisfy my desires to do something a little more meaningful with my life."

I had started many projects either on my own, or often in collaboration with the Computer Science House (CSH) organization at RIT. Most of the leisure work I did fell under trying to develop two-dimensional top-down role-playing games, exploring the different tools that programming languages had to offer (particularly C, C#, and Rust), and quite a bit of substandard API development, such as with the CSH Devcade project (though most of my contributions have largely been overwritten). Through all of these projects, there was never really anything to grab my attention past getting a general understanding for how different tools worked. What I really wanted was to dive into an area that was still actively being explored, that way my hunger to understand could never be satiated."

This course covered everything from the basics concepts of an intelligent system (like the inductive learning hypothesis and inductive bias for example), the fundamentals of unsupervised learning (like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and PCA), and basic classifiers to some slightly more complex topics like neural networks (and their extensions, like accounting for momentum and weight decay), reinforcement learning (Q-Learning, mostly), and temporal probability models (i.e. Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi Algorithm). Clearly, I had my work cut out for me. While taking this course certainly took away a lot of my free time, I ended up gaining a solid understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning."
